> A little description of the image

### commencement
lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetul, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore, et al eiusmod tempor incididunt


The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that  elements aren't given a child tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.

- **For example, here's another nested list.**

  But this time with a second paragraph.

  - These list items won't have  tags
  - Because they are only one line each

- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**

  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.

  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a  tag.

    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.

  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.

- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?

And finally a sentence to close off this section.

## There are other elements we need to style
